                The Future Needs Real Faces

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                AI video generation is moving at lightning speed. Before we know it, most of the content we consume—ads, films, campaigns—will be AI-generated or AI-assisted.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Why? Because it's cheaper, faster, and infinitely scalable.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Soon, every company will be asking themselves: "Why would I pay market rate for a real actor when I can just work with AI?"
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                And here's the truth: without platforms like LikeLee, the answer might be "You wouldn't."

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Brands know this. Audiences want to see real faces, real diversity, real humanity in the content they consume—even if that content is AI-generated.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your face gives AI content its humanity. Your likeness makes it relatable. Your appearance is what transforms a synthetic video into something people actually connect with.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Companies need you. They just need a way to work with you that makes sense in this new landscape.

                For too long, getting seen has been nearly impossible for most people:

                <li>Algorithms prioritize certain looks and engagement patterns</li>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The path to visibility has been narrow and exclusionary—not by intent, but by the realities of how the industry has worked.

                Now, anyone can be in a campaign. Your face doesn't need to fit a mold. You don't need a million followers. You don't need to be what the algorithm is looking for. You just need to be you.

                <li><strong>Work With Brands You Care About.</strong> See yourself in campaigns for companies you actually want to represent. Get the visibility you always wanted, but could never access through traditional channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Paid Fairly.</strong> Earn real compensation for your likeness. Every time your face appears in content, you get paid. Transparent rates. Clear terms. No exploitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Seen, Finally.</strong> No more algorithm battles. No more wondering if you'll ever get the chance. Your face has value, and brands are actively looking for authentic, diverse faces like yours.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Full Control.</strong> You decide where your face appears. Set your usage terms. Approve or deny content categories. Your likeness, your rules.</li>

                We know what you're risking by licensing your likeness. We've seen the horror stories—faces showing up in scam videos, unauthorized deepfakes, content creators never approved.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                That's why security is our biggest pillar.

                <li><strong>You Set the Terms.</strong> Your face will never appear in content you haven't explicitly approved. You control the categories, the brands, the usage types. If it's not in your terms, it doesn't happen.</li>
                <li><strong>Facial Tracking & Monitoring.</strong> We aim to implement technology that tracks every use of your likeness. You'll be notified each time your face appears in content—authorized or not.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Against Misuse.</strong> If someone attempts to use your face without authorization, or distributes unauthorized content, we're here to protect you. Legal backing. Active monitoring. Immediate action.</li>

                This Is Your Opportunity
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As AI video takes over, companies will have a choice: create lifeless, generic content with synthetic faces, or create authentic, relatable content with real people like you.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The brands that choose authenticity will win. The ones that choose humanity will connect with audiences. And they need your face to do it.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But here's what makes this different from traditional paths: you don't have to be perfect. You don't have to fit a specific mold. You don't have to game algorithms or spend years building a following first.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                You just have to be willing to be seen.

                The gatekeepers are gone. The barriers are down. For the first time, anyone can participate in the content economy—not by creating content themselves, but by being part of it.
