              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                We're standing at the edge of the most dramatic shift in content creation since the camera was invented. AI video generation isn't coming—it's here. And it's about to change everything about how you create campaigns, advertisements, and films.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The question isn't whether AI will transform your industry. The question is: will you be ready?

                The Problem With AI (As It Exists Today)
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Right now, AI in advertising feels like the Wild West. Brands that want to experiment face impossible choices:
              </p>
              <ul className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2 pl-8 list-disc">
                <li>Hire expensive production teams who may or may not understand AI tools</li>
                <li>Use faceless, soulless AI avatars that audiences can smell from a mile away</li>
                <li>Navigate legal nightmares around unauthorized likeness use</li>
                <li>Compromise on quality because no one knows how to do this right yet</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Meanwhile, the talented freelancers and creators who could make incredible AI-assisted content sit on the sidelines, either unaware of the opportunity or unable to connect with brands that need them.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                This isn't a market. It's a mess.

                Why We Built LikeLee
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                We believe AI should amplify human creativity, not replace it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                LikeLee exists to create the ecosystem where brands and creators can collaborate on AI-generated content that feels authentic, looks incredible, and performs better than anything you've seen before—all while keeping the human element at the center.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Here's what we're building:
              </p>
              <ul className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 pl-8 list-disc">
                <li><strong>A marketplace where quality meets opportunity.</strong> Connect with vetted freelancers who specialize in AI campaigns. Small teams with big capabilities. Creators who understand both the technology and the art.</li>
                <li><strong>Economics that make sense.</strong> Create advertisements, campaigns, and even full-length films at 95%+ below traditional market price. Not because we're cutting corners—because we're cutting overhead.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay for results, not promises.</strong> Our royalty-based model means you pay when your content performs. No more massive upfront production costs for campaigns that might flop.</li>
                <li><strong>The highest quality, on demand.</strong> Whether you need a 15-second spot or a feature film, access talent and tools that deliver satisfaction at scale. Iterate fast. Ship faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal clarity in a murky world.</strong> Every piece of content created through LikeLee comes with transparent, secure licensing. No surprise lawsuits. No unauthorized usage. Just clean, trackable rights.</li>
              </ul>

                The Future We're Creating
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As AI video generation improves—and it will, dramatically—you'll see a higher concentration of AI-assisted and AI-generated content everywhere:
              </p>
              <ul className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 pl-8 list-disc">
                <li>Commercials that personalize to regional audiences in real-time</li>
                <li>Campaign iterations that used to take weeks, done in hours</li>
                <li>Hyper-targeted content that resonates because it's crafted, not mass-produced</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                LikeLee is building the infrastructure for this future.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We're not just a platform. We're the connective tissue between brands who need groundbreaking content and the creators who can make it happen. We're the economic model that makes AI production accessible to everyone from scrappy startups to Fortune 500 giants. We're the legal framework that lets everyone sleep at night.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12">
                This Is About More Than Cost Savings
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Yes, you'll save millions. Yes, you'll move faster than your competitors. Yes, you'll unlock creative possibilities that don't exist today.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                But more than that, you'll be part of keeping AI human.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Every campaign you create through LikeLee keeps a real creator in the loop. Pays them fairly. Respects their contribution. Proves that AI doesn't have to mean the end of human artistry—it can mean the beginning of something even better.
